This is an integration test, which checks the entire end-to-end workflow of the application. Specifically, this test:
- create a user account and check if the confirmation message appears.
- browse and add the product to the cart and check if the product has been added correctly.
- complete the checkout process: (complete the delivery form, select the delivery and payment method, and complete the order).
